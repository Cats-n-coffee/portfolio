This is my portfolio, check it out http://www.luciealonso.com.
It is hosted on Netlify and uses their form service since there is no backend set up.

I used HTML, SCSS and JS. First time using the IntersectionObserver API, and it was fairly simple 
to set up for the animations in the projects section. The home page dots animation taking almost a
second to appear, I delayed the text animation so there is no jumping.
The dots animation has its own seperate partial called home-animation.

Thank you for reading!
